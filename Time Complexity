How to guess the solution for DSA problems?

Yes, it is possible.

You can predict the solution for a problem by analyzing the constraints.

Curious if you need a greedy approach or a backtracking solution? Trying to decide between an O(n^3) or an O(n log n) approach? Just scroll down the LeetCode question and look at the constraints of the main element.

Wondering if you should use dynamic programming or plain recursion? Should your solution be O(n^2) or O(n)? Simply examine the constraints of the main variable.

Here's a quick guide based on the value of (n):

 - If n <= 12 Time complexity can be O(n!).
 - If n <= 25 Time complexity can be O(2^n).
 - If n <= 100 Time complexity can be O(n^4).
 - If n <= 500 Time complexity can be O(n^3).
 - If n <= 10 ^ 4 Time complexity can be O(n^2).
 - If n <= 10 ^ 6 Time complexity can be O(n log n).
 - If n <= 10 ^ 8 Time complexity can be O(n).
 - If n > 10 ^ 8 Time complexity can be O(log n) or 0(1).
 - If n <= 10 ^ 9 Time complexity can be O(sqrt{n}).
 - If n > 10 ^ 9 Time complexity can be O(log n) or 0(1).

Understanding these constraints can help you choose the right algorithm and improve your problem-solving efficiency.
